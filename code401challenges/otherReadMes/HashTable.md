## Implementation of MergeSort

## Challenge Description
- add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.


## Approach & Efficiency
- Maps keys of any data type to an integer
- Hash function maps keys to int
- Collision occurs when more than and value has the same hashed
 values
- add to hash tables provide a key/value pair
- Use a hash function to hash the key to an int value
- Store value at the hashed key value
- get a value from a hash table provide the key
- use the same hash function to hash the key to an int value 
- retrieve the value stored
