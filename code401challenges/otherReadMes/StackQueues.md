## Implementation: Stacks and Queues


## Challenge
- Stack goes by FILO
- Queues goes by FIFO

## Approach and Efficiency
- The stack has a top that I keep track of
- The queue has a first that I keep track of

## API
- Stack 
    push() - adds items into the stack
    pop() - removes items from the stack starting at the top
    peek() - checks to see if a value is in the stack
    isEmpty() - checks to see if the stack is empty
    
- Queue
    enqueue() - adds items to the queue
    dequeue() - removes items from the queue
    peek() - checks to see if a value is in the queue
    isEmpty() - checks to see if the queue is empty
